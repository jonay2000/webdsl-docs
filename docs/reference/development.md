## Debugging the generated code (developers)

When running an application entirely in the Eclipse environment, you can choose to start debug mode in the 'Servers' view.

On the command-line, 'webdsl run' will set up the remote debugger interface, on the usual port 8000. Then set it up in eclipse: Run menu -> debug configurationsâ€¦ -> click on remote java applications -> new (icon top left) -> add source dirs of your project -> press 'debug'
